# Action items

Software engineers track tasks via tickets.
However, for broader teams, actions can be laid out on many different pages on confluence.
It is advisable to create a central page that tracks:

1. Actions
2. Action descriptions
3. Criteria of success & deliverables 
4. Due dates
5. Assignees
6. Links to where tasks were originally defined 
7. Time estimates? 
8. Blocked?
